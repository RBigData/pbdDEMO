\section{Introduction}

Distance is not only a tool in geometry, but also appears in statistics. For
example, least square method in regression can be simply derived and computed
via Euclidean distance. The solution line is an approximate answer
in terms of minimum distance to all observations. Distance is also related
to a measure of two observations which describes relationship of both.
Usually, the smaller the closer. For example, the higher probability of
one virus evolving to a mutant means the smaller distance of two viruses
as described in Chapter~\ref{chp:phyloclustering}.
Further, distance method is simple to apply on clustering problems
and easy to visualize data structures such as K-means algorithm
introduced in Chapter~\ref{chp:pmclust}. For instance,
the observations of the same group are more similar in characteristics with
each other than those between different groups.


\subsection{Distributed Distance and Comparisons}

Suppose $x$ and $y$ are two observations and $d(x, y)$ is a distance or
a comparison of $x$ and $y$.
Although, it is efficient to compute a distance of any two observations
in \proglang{R} via \code{dist()} serially, it becomes non-trivial to
compute distance of distributed observations in parallel.
The potential problems are:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Communication must be evoked between processors when any two observations
are not located within the same processor.
\item
The resulting distance matrix may be too big
to held in one processor as data size increased even only a half (lower
triangular of the matrix is stored.
\item
Compute all comparisons may be too time consuming even for small data sets. 
\end{itemize}

The \code{dist()} only supports a few distance methods and assume
distance is symmetric by definition. However,
in practice, a more general measure may not be necessarily
symmetric of two observations. i.e. $d(x, y) \neq d(y, x)$.
In some cases, $d(x, x) \neq 0$.
