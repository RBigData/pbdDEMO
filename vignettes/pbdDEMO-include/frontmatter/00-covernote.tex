The picture on the cover, \textit{Join, or Die}~\citep{franklin1754join}, is
from a well-known political cartoon to those familiar with United States
history.  It has since become known as a symbol of unity to Americans.  For more
historical information and context, the reader is encouraged to see the 
well-documented Wikipedia entry 
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join%2C_or_Die#Legacy_of_the_cartoon}.

The inclusion of this symbol here is not intended to be political.  In the 
context of distributed computing, the multiple nodes must "join or die".  
In this document, we will learn how to join together multiple nodes to 
solve problems in statistics using MPI, accessible from R.
